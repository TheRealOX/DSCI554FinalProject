        <h2><strong> Data Source</strong></h2>

        <p>This analysis aims to use historical regular season data of teams in the NBA to experiment with predicting a
            team's Championship score at the end of the postseason. The metric is calculated as a team's total number of
            wins in the playoffs divided by the total number of games the eventual champion wins. For example, the 2022
            Golden State Warriors won a total of 16 games en route to their title, and for Utah Jazz, which won 2 games,
            it would have a championship score of 2/16 = 0.125. As a result, if the model predicts a team to have the
            highest championship score out of all teams that make the playoffs, that team will be the expected champion
            of the season. </p>

        <p>Data is obtained with automated HTML parsing from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">Basketball
                Reference</a>, a site that has detailed stats on every NBA game dating
            back to 1950, though the more advanced stats were introduced later on (for example, 3-pointer became
            official in 1979). It also includes some additional information on previously won individual awards of
            players on a team. For example, for the 2022 Philadelphia 76ers, its players have a combined 13 All-NBA team
            nominations, 8 All-NBA defensive team selections, 3 NBA Championships, etc..
            The original data contains 92 columns and 1573 rows, with a time ranging between 1950 and 2022. The
            data contains some "NaN" values, most of which originate from the missing stats from the early period
            between 1950 to 1980. As a result, we choose to remove all data before the 1980 season as the data after
            1980 contains no empty value.</p>

        <h2>What We Found</h2>
        <p>
            In this bar chart, we can use the slide bar to change team salary data in different years, and the
            championships
            from 2010 to 2022 are listed on the right side. We can discover around half of the championship teams rank
            at the
            top of each year’s salary. Thus, we believe that there is a positive correlation between the championship
            and a
            team’s spending on salary.

        <h2>What We Found</h2>
        <p>
            The analysis performed through multiple repeats is sensitive to the split between training and test data as
            well as the random state of the models. The results would vary to a certain degree, from predicting all past
            3 NBA Champions correctly to predicting none correctly. Even though the model does not seem quite to capture
            the defining characteristics of a team that would correlate with success in the playoffs, it is precisely
            this randomness that anything could happen in a postseason that keeps fans on the edge of their seats. The
            graphs below present the prediction of the NBA Champions of the past three seasons compared to the actual
            championship score.
