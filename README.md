## Project summary (max 250 words)

This paper presents the NBA Champions Analysis and Prediction, a project that utilizes various visualizations scores of analysis and machine learning models to predict. We first discuss how the basic stats relate to a team’s performance in the finals. Then, we explore other factor that may have an influence on the outcome of the play-offs. Finally, We evaluate the performance of two Machine Learning models that use historical NBA regular season data to predict the last three seasons’ champions.
